# pizza_delivery
This project addresses a critical business challenge for a pizza delivery store: the "30-Minute Guarantee." By leveraging Databricks and the Medallion Architecture, I built a system that predicts delivery delays before they happen, allowing the business to manage financial loss from free pizzas and improve customer satisfaction.
